# Problem 1

In a unix-like operating system, you could fire up a console application and type a command. To do this you first run the console program. For example, in OSX, the console is launched with by running "term". Inside the console, you could run a program. For example, typing "date <ret>" gives you the current date. In this case, the program "date" is a system app located in directory /bin. You can also run a program you have previously built. For example, if the program "hello" in in your current directory, you run it by typing "./hello".

The problem is t write a program that asks the user to type in his/her name on the _console input_, and print the string "Hello, <name>", where <name> is what the user previous typed for his/her name on the _console output_.
